Welcome to Pete's Color Python Script.

To use the script simply add it to your project directory and import it.

This script containts 3 main functions that you will use, they are:

- cprint
- print_all_colours
- add_custom_colour

cprint - Like 'print' however you can specify a main colour and an alt colour which will allow you to print coloured text to the terminal.
         to use this command simply type 'cprint("name of the colour", "the text to print", [optinal]alt_colour)'.
         To use the alt colour you will simply insert 2 '.#'. The first will be where you want the alt colour to start and the second will be
         where the alt colour will end.

         EXAMPLE: cprint(colour_name='red', alt_colour='light blue', text_to_print='This will be red .# and this will be light blue.# and now we are back to red.')

         You can enter this symbol multiple times, but always remember to wrap the text you want to colourize with 2 of '.#'

print_all_colours - Loops through the 'colours.txt' and will print out every colour with the colour's name. This includes custom colours 
                    added with the 'add_custom_colour' function.

add_custom_colour - Allows the user to specify a custom colour to add to their 'colours.txt' file, allowing them to use it whenever they like.
                    The function takes 4 arguments, colour_name, r, g, and b. 
                    The 'colour_name' is a custom name for the new colour, which the user will use anytime they want to use this colour.
                    The 'r', 'g' and 'b' values are the RGB values respectively. If you have trouble figuring out an RGB value, you can goto
                    "https://rgbcolorcode.com/" and simply copy the RGB values of the colour you want to have. If you want to create a custom
                    colour or simply do not know the name, you can use 'W3Schools Color Picker' (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
                    to create your own perfect colours!
